 # Echo Project - Progress Log

**Project:** Echo Custom Wrapper (The True Origin Story)
**Author:** Charles (Eric) Wilson
**Start Date:** April 2026

This log documents the beginning of the Echo agent project — starting from the very first simple Python wrapper.

## Phase 0: The Starting Point (Infrastructure)

**Date:** January 2026
**Infrastructure build**
- Review Python code and build Rust environment
- Install and update Rust build environment with apt and rustup

**Repos at this stage:**
- https://github.com/charlesericwilson-portfolio/Echo_agent/tree/main

## Phase 1: Create base script

**Date:** January 2026
**Reverse engineer python wrapper Initial Coding**

**Goal:** Build a minimal script that lets the LLM output 'COMMAND: some_command' and have it executed locally in Rust.

**What I built:**
- Basic loop that sends messages to the local LLM
- Regex detection for 'COMMAND:'
- 'subprocess' execution with output capture
- Simple safety deny list
- Output saved to timestamped files

**Files at this stage:**
- 'cargo.toml' - The dependancies
- 'no_log_wrapper_main.rs' - The first working version
- 'cargo.lock

## Phase 2: Refinement

**Date:** January 2026
**Test refine and write scripts.**

**Goal** Refine the logging, and visual appeal.

**What I built**
- Refined loop with time and date stamped tool output,and chat logging to jsonl.
- Added colors to chat interface.
- Fine tuned the system prompt to prevent looping
- Implimented context file, short term, and long term memory files

**Files and repos at this stage:**
- main.rs - Final script

## Phase 3: Build

**Date:** January 2026
**Compile Test and Document.**

**Goal** Functioning documented rust executable

**What I built**
- Echo_rust.sh - Final executable
- Project artifacts

**Files at this stage:**
- Echo_chat.sh
- screenshots

**Lessons Learned:**
- Simple regex-based tool calling actually works surprisingly well for one-shot commands.
- Keeping everything minimal makes debugging much easier.
- Safety deny list is important even in the early version.
- code length exploded using rust definitly more than I was expecting.

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with more complex architectures (persistent sessions, heartbeat, orchestrator)
- Document everything as we go
